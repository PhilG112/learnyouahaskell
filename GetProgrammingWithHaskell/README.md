## Unit 01

### 2 FUNCTIONS AND FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

- Understand the general idea of functional programming
- Define simple functions in Haskell
- Declare variables in Haskell
- Explain the benefits of functional programming

### 3 LAMBDA FUNCTIONS AND LEXICAL SCOPE

- Write lambda functions in Haskell
- Use lambda functions for ad hoc function definitions
- Understand lexical scope
- Create scope with a lambda function

### 4 FIRST-CLASS FUNCTIONS

- Understand the definition of first-class functions
- Use functions as arguments to other functions
- Abstract computation out of a function
- Return functions as values

### 5 CLOSURES AND PARTIAL APPLICATION

- Capture values in a lambda expression
- Use closures to create new functions
- Simplify this process with partial application
